            'The aim of the school is to cover a wide range of topics associated with thermal neutron scattering, including powder diffraction, stress analysis, texture, reflectometry, and small-angle neutron scattering together with the underlying theory associated with neutron scattering.',
            'The lectures are aimed at beginning graduate students who have a wide variety of backgrounds in the sciences, such as physics, chemistry, materials science, structural biology, mineralogy. Therefore, graduate students, postdocs, faculty and industrial scientists should profit from attending the school. The theory will be presented in a way that should be understood by people in any of these fields.',
