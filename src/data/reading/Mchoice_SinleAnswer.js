Located in modern day Cambodia near Lake Tonle Sap, the largest freshwater lake in Asia, Angkor was the seat of power for the Khmer Empire from the ninth to the fifteenth century. The ruins of Angkor are documented as some of the most impressive ones in the world, rivaling the pyramids of Giza in Egypt. Why this mighty civilization died out is a question that archeologists are now only beginning to ponder. The answer, it turns out, may be linked with the availability of fresh water. One possible explanation for the downfall of the Khmer Empire has to do with the inhabitants’ irrigation system. The temple and palaces of Angkor were constructed around a series of artificial reservoirs and canals which were annually flooded to capacity by the Mekong River. Once filled, they were used to irrigate the surrounding rice patties and farmland during the course of the year. Farmers were completely dependent upon the water for their crucial rice crop. Without consistent irrigation, the farmers would have been unable to maintain functional crop production.`,

    para: `Shadow puppetry is a traditional art form that often goes unappreciated in modern times. A large part of the appeal of puppet shows is the craftsmanship behind the creation of the actual puppets. In shadow puppetry, on the other hand, the puppets remain unseen, so the real artistry is in the presentation. The combination of the puppet’s shape, the background screen, and the light itself creates the overall effect of the shadow puppet show. The task of the director is to ensure these elements are working together harmoniously in order to produce the optimal experience for the audience. The screen is the medium through which the audience experiences the performance, so selecting the best screen is essential. First, it must transmit as much light as possible to better capture the shape of the puppet. However, it shouldn’t transmit so much light that the puppeteer is visible. The material should obviously be durable but thin. A thin material gives superior definition to the edges of the shadows. Traditionally, cotton was used for the screen, but it was very grainy. As new kinds of textiles have been developed, more suitable materials have become the standard. Silk works well but it is very expensive. A more affordable option is vinyl, which is thin and transmits light evenly. However, if the material stretches too easily, it will sag.`,

However, many of these exoplanets are as large as Jupiter, and it is unlikely that they are habitable. A planet in the habitable zone means the planet is located at a distance from its sun suitable enough to allow for the existence of water on its surface. This is called the Goldilocks position, meaning the planet is neither too hot or too cold. In order to find planets that are light years from our own solar system, astronomers use two types of telescope, each with sensitive instruments that employ special techniques, to aid in the acquisition of data: ground-based and orbiting telescopes. In 2007, a team of Swiss scientists discovered the first Earth like planet outside of our solar system, Gliese 5S1, estimated to be approximately 50 percent bigger than Earth. Located about 20.5 light years from our world, Gliese 581 orbits a red dwarf star.

In the middle of Egypt, on the west bank of the Nile River lies the Valley of the Kings. This ancient burial place is where 63 royal tombs have been found. The bodies of pharaohs, their family members, and their trusted leaders are buried there. The earliest tombs date back to the 16th century B.C. According to historians, this area was used for the burial of kings for a period of 500 years. After this, the tombs were forgotten, only to be visited by grave robbers. The robbers stole many of the artifacts and removed whatever valuable objects they could. Archaeologists rediscovered the tombs in the late 1700's. Despite the work of the grave robbers, the graves still displayed the great power and wealth of those buried there. Many tombs were decorated with paintings of Egyptian mythology . These paintings gave archaeologists clues as to what the ancient Egyptians believed. One interesting belief was that the objects in the grave would be used by the dead person in the afterlife. Clothing, games, and walking sticks were found in the tomb of King Tutankhamen, or King Tut. Tut's grave was one of the only undisturbed graves--the grave robbers never got to it. The artifacts show us how the people who buried King Tut wanted to provide for him in the afterlife. Archaeologists continue to explore the Valley of the Kings.

It is also used to refer to other metals, including brass, which is an alloy of copper and zinc. In any case, bronze is a strong and enduring material which can capture fine and complex details within a casting mould. This dark reddish-brown metal has been used in European countries since antiquity. It has been used to create tools, weapons, sculpture, and decorative works. These applications continued throughout the medieval period. In the 15th century, for example, there was a deliberate revival of the forms and techniques of ancient Greece and Rome. How is bronze cast? There are two basic ways: sand casting, a simple technique that uses moulds made of compact, fine sand; and lost-wax casting, which, on the other hand, is a complex process using wax models. Furthermore, there is also the “direct” method, in which the original wax model is used, and, therefore, destroyed; finally, there is also the “indirect” method, in which plaster moulds are taken from the original wax, which makes them suitable to be reused many times.`,

Test scores in the USA also stumped ten percent during the 1990s despite the country riding an economic boom for much of the decade.

This reversal of fortunes has led to widespread contention over the pedagogy of teaching Literacy. What was once a dry and technical affair—the esoteric business of linguists and policy analysts—rapidity escalated into a series of skirmishes that were prayed out in high-visibility forums : Newspapers ran special features, columns and letters-to-the-editor on the literacy crisis; politicians successfully ran their national campaigns on improving reading test scores; and parents had their say by joining Parent Teacher Associations (PTAs) and lobby groups.`,

Johannes Gutenberg was a pioneer in the use of movable type. When he began building a printing press in 1436, he was unlikely to have realized that he was giving birth to an art form that would take center stage in the social and industrial revolutions that followed. Gutenberg was German, his press was wooden, and the most important aspect of his invention was that it was the first form of printing to use movable type. Although Laurence Koster of Haarlem also laid claim to the invention, scholars have generally accepted Gutenberg as the father of modern painting. Before Gutenberg, the printing press was used only to reproduce pictures, playing cards, and designs on cloth. Designs were cut in wood, stone, or metal and transfered to parchment or vellum. Sometimes a few words of explanation were cut into the printing block, but that was the limit of text printing. Books were copied by hand by monks, which was a labor-intensive undertaking.`,

A spark from a nearby source could set off a small fire and the burning clothes would cause a person’s body fat to melt, adding fuel to the fire. In a poorly ventilated room, the body can burn for hours and cause the kind of damage seen in many of the supposed SHC cases. In this scenario, the combustion is not spontaneous at all and is always caused by some external fire source. In a recent experiment, the criminologist Dr. John de Haan put the wick theory to the test. De Haan wrapped a dead pig (chosen because the body fat of a pig is similar to that of a human) in a blanket, poured gasoline over it, set it on fire and then let it burn in a badly ventilated room. After burning for several hours, the body of the pic was reduced to ashes, much like the bodies of many supposed SHC victims. De Haan’s experiment did not persuade everyone that the wick theory explains SHC. Some believe there are still too many unanswered questions in many of the cases. What about the situations where no external source of the fire was found or where victims have burst into flame in front of witnesses? Until scientists come up with a theory that explains all of these circumstances, many will likely continue to believe in the possibility of spontaneous human combustion`,

But, in September 2013, 11 children in Paraguay were admitted to the hospital shortly after receiving cough syrup for their cold symptoms. These children experienced severe breathing problems, hallucinations and seizures — and over the following weeks, dozens of other Paraguayan children were hospitalized with the same alarming drug reactions. As it transpired, the culprit was not dextromethorphan, but contamination by the drug’s mirror version. Levomethorphan has the same size, weight and chemical makeup as dextromethorphan, but with a reversed structure. This subtle change has major ramifications, as the compound is an opioid five times stronger than morphine. Paraguayan authorities and the World Health Organization (WHO) subsequently traced the defective drug back to a factory in India, which had previously shipped a similarly contaminated batch of cough syrup to Pakistan. "It was ultimately implicated in the deaths of more than 50 people in Pakistan," says Leonel Santos, director of chemical medicines at USP, also known as the United States Pharmacopeia. Fortunately, close vigilance by manufacturers and regulators mitigates and intercepts most drug impurities before they can harm people. “Issues related to impurities represent a significant factor in drug recalls throughout the world,” says Jaap Venema, USP’s chief science officer. USP plays a central role in medicine safety. “We design tests and quality standards that help detect and control for impurities at various stages of production, not only in the end-product, but during manufacturing,” Venema says.

Our research examined the relationship between boredom and creativity on a range of tasks and found that engaging in boring activities such as tedious writing exercises before undertaking creative tasks results in more productive thinking. We believe that the reason for this was that boredom allows daydreaming, which is a key to creativity. To measure whether creativity was indeed a result of daydreaming, a subsequent study was conducted based on similar activities but instead focused on reading instead of writing. The first study involved participants copying telephone numbers from a phone directory for 15 minutes so that we could explore the impact on subsequent levels of creativity shown in a divergent thinking task. Participants provided varied examples such as pencil pots, earrings, drums and plan pots. We found that the number of creative answers were higher for participants who completed a boredom task followed by the creative task than participants who completed the creative task in isolation. However, in the next study we had people read the phone numbers and found that levels of creativity then to be even higher. This suggests that passive activities, like reading or attending meetings, can lead to more creativity whereas writing, which inherently reduces the scope for daydreaming, lessens the chance to be creative.`,

The upper body of the victim is a heap of ashes, but one or more mostly undamaged hands or feet may be visible as well. A layer of blackened grease covers the ceiling and walls above the victim's head, but fire damage in the room is limited to a small area right around and above the body. Objects only a few feet away remain untouched by the blaze. Police investigators find no obvious source or cause for the fire. This scene describes a typical case of spontaneous human combustion (SHC), in which a human body is supposedly able to burst into flames and to burn to almost nothing entirely on its own. In most SHC cases there are no witnesses to see how the person caught fire. However, sometimes there are. In a few cases the observer, who is often a friend or family member, sees the person burst into flame and tries to put out the fire. Occasionally the victim survives. Again, there is no clear outside cause─the blaze appears to start from within the victim's own body. This phenomenon is actually nothing new. A 1763 book by Frenchman Jonas Dupont with the title “De Incendiis Corporis Humani Spontaneis" describes in detail a number of cases of SHC. A century later Charles Dickens used SHC to kill off one of the characters in his novel Bleak House. A number of more recent unexplained deaths have helped to keep the theory of SHC alive.

    para: `Unemployment was the overriding fact of life when Franklin D. Roosevelt became president of the United States on March 4, 1933. An anomaly of the time was that the government did not systematically collect statistics of joblessness; actually it did not start doing so until 1940. The Bureau of Labor Statistics later estimated that 12,830,000 persons were out of work in 1933, about one-fourth of a civilian labor force of more than 51 million. Roosevelt signed the Federal Emergency Relief Act on May 12, 1933. The president selected Harry L. Hopkins, who headed the New York relief program, to run FERA. A gifted administrator, Hopkins quickly put the program into high gear. He gathered a small staff in Washington and brought the state relief organizations into the FERA system. While the agency tried to provide all the necessities, food came first. City dwellers usually got an allowance for fuel, and rent for one month was provided in case of eviction.`,

    para: `Precipitation is essential for any type of farming, and since the development of agriculture man has attempted to gain influence over or to control this life giving phenomenon. For much of human history, such efforts have been the province of shamans, witch doctors, and priests, who have sought to enlist the aid of the supernatural in bringing steady and reliable rains during the growing season. In fact, in many earlier societies, the great authority afforded to such individuals was explicitly based on their claims to supposedly command the rains to come. In modern times, most societies have turned away from such supertisions. Rain-making efforts continue today, albeit under the guise of science. Modern rain-making efforts center around the practice of cloud seeding, in which certain chemicals (usually silver iodide) are released into the atmosphere to induce precipitation. In order to understand this process, it is first necessary to understand what causes precipitation under natural circumstances.`,

    para: `Grossly misunderstood and represented as a revolutionary, liberal, Romantic, and bohemian artist, Rembrandt has lived for over 400 years now through his art. During this time period many views and opinions have oscillated from praise to scathing remarks and vice versa. The extent of Rembrandt's fame can be understood by the following incident: in the year 1670, the Sicilian collector Antonio Ruffo received a letter from the artist Abraham Breughel with a request to get some original masterpieces from Italy. Ruffo had to apologize stating that no painter had been able to exhibit an ability to paint as extraordinary as Rembrandt, who had already died by then.`,

    para: `The original idea for The Statue of Liberty was proposed by Edouard de Laboulaye, President of the French Anti-Slavery Society. A staunch political thinker and an abolitionist, Edouard Laboulaye, who supported the Union in the American Civil War, supposedly suggested the idea to the famous sculptor Frederic Bartholdi. He is supposed to have said that a memorial must be created as a toast to American independence and it must be built up with a common effort from both the countries. Another report suggests that Laboulaye believed that if this gift to the United States were built up on behalf of France, the French would feel encouraged to get over monarchy and call for democracy. In 1870, Bartholdi created the first model and then, even after returning to France, continued to improvise on the design.`,

    para: `Humans have evolved to be remarkably sensitive to the potential of any given environment to yield food. They respond to, and are motivated by, any stimulus that is predictive of such a reward. Indeed, these stimuli, though not in themselves rewarding, may come to be valued and to enhance pleasure almost as much as the actual foods that they portend. The sights and smells of food and food-related stimuli drive behavior very powerfully. In responding to foods, just as in trying to comprehend our environment, we remain reliant upon the complex interaction between our perceptions and our prior experience. Recognizing this link could help us to understand the emergence of health-harming behaviors relating to food.`,

    para: `The world American colonists lived in during the eighteenth century was changing and becoming more complex. Between 1700 and 1750 the population in the English colonies increased from 250,000 to one million. In the seventeenth century most of the immigrants to English North America came from England. In the eighteenth century they came instead from Scotland, Northern Ireland, Wales, and Germany. In 1660 there were approximately 2,920 Africans living in the colonies. By 1760 there were 300,000 -- an increase of 1700 percent! In the southern colonies Africans made up 40 per cent of the total population and by 1720 Africans were the majority population in South Carolina. Most of the population increase in the colonies came from natural increase. The American colonial economy was built on and sustained by trade and these capitalist societies were tied increasingly to the economic network that spanned the Atlantic. Two revolutions took place during the eighteenth century: a consumer revolution and an industrious revolution. American religious, intellectual, and cultural life in the eighteenth century changed because of two movements: the Enlightenment and the Great Awakening. Both contributed to the humanitarianism that emerged at the end of the century and both were products of the world that capitalism created. The society in the eighteen-century became more diversified than it used to be.`,

    para: `During any space mission, whether it is manned or unmanned, the two most critical periods are liftoff and reentry. This fact is proven by the fact that every loss of life in the history of space exploration has occurred during a liftoff or reentry maneuver. Liftoff and reentry not only represent the times of greatest danger during a space mission, they also present the greatest science and engineering challenges to the planners and organizers of a space mission. The major challenge during liftoff is to achieve a great enough velocity to break free of the Earth’s gravitational pull and escape the atmosphere. The velocity required varies depending on the type of the mission in question. For example, most orbital missions, like those to the International Space Station or the launching of a satellite, do not require the spacecraft to complete escape Earth’s gravitation pull. These spacecrafts simply need enough velocity to achieve a certain distance from Earth and then to maintain their orbit. The speed is needed for this is dependent on the type of orbit desired, but is generally around 24,000 kilometers per hour. Completely escaping the Earth’s gravity, as is need for interplanetary mission, is a far more difficult undertaking requiring a speed of 40,200 kilometers per hour`,
    ques: `Why are interplanetary missions more difficult?`,
    ans: [
      `Because they require more fuel`,
      `Because they use larger spacecraft.`,
