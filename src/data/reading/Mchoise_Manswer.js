    para: " Most stones have capillary passages that suck salt water from the wet ground. Death Valley provides an ultradry atmosphere and high daily temperatures, which promote evaporation and the formation of salt crystals along cracks or other openings within stones. These crystals grow as long as salt water is available. Like tree roots breaking a sidewalk, the growing crystals exert pressures on the rock and eventually pry the rock apart along planes of weakness, such as banding in metamorphic rocks, bedding in sedimentary rocks, preexisting or incipient fractures, and along boundaries between individual mineral crystals or grains. Besides crystal growth, the expansion of halite crystals by heating and of sulfates and similar salts by hydration can contribute additional stresses. A rock durable enough to have served as your great, great, ever so great grandfather's tombstone could probably be shattered into small pieces by salt weathering within a few generations. ",

For the Egyptians, non-existence was an intolerable concept, and it was believed that, at death, the soul traveled to the Hall of Truth where it was judged by Osiris and the 42 Judges by having its heart weighed in balance with the white feather of truth; if the heart was found lighter than the feather, the soul proceeded on to the afterlife, while if it was heavier, it was thrown to the floor where it was eaten by a monster and the soul would cease to exist. One's heart would be lighter if one had lived a good life and heavier if one had not. The afterlife was known as the Field of Reeds, which was a mirror image of one's life on earth in Egypt. One would enjoy the house one knew, the stream by that house, one's favorite tree and dog, and so there was no reason for a soul to want to return to earth unless that soul had a very good reason for doing so. If properly buried with adequate rites and continually remembered, the spirits of the dead could be of great benefit to the living and watch over them throughout their lives.

But the year was 1852, and the setting was the office of the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India in the northern hill station of Debra Dun. According to the most plausible version of what transpired, a clerk rushed into the chambers of Sir Andrew Waugh, India's surveyor general, and exclaimed that a Bengali computer named Radhanath Sikhdar, working out of the Survey's Calcutta bureau, had 'discovered the highest mountain in the world.(In Waugh's day a computer was a job description rather than a machine.) Designated Peak XV by surveyors in the field who'd first measured the angle of its rise with a twenty- four - inch theodolite three years earlier, the mountain in paration jutted from the spine of the Himalaya in the forbidden kingdom of Nepal.Until Sikhdar compiled the survey data and did the math, nobody had suspected that there was anything noteworthy about Peak XV.The six survey sites from which the summit had been triangulated were in northern India, more than a hundred miles from the mountain.To the surveyors who shot it, all but the summit nub of Peak XV several was obscured by various high escarpments in the foreground, of which gave the illusion of being much greater in stature.But according to Sikhdar's meticulous trigonometric reckoning (which took curvature of the earth, atmospheric reinto account such factors as fraction, and plumb-line deflection) Peak XV stood 29,002* feet above sea level, the planet's loftiest point.In 1865, nine years after Sikhdar's computations had been confirmed, Waugh bestowed the name Mount Everest on Peak XV, in honor of Sir George Everest, his predecessor as surveyor general. As it happened, Tibetans who lived to the north of the great mountain already had a more mellifluous name for it, Jornolurignia, which translates to 'goddess, mother of the world,' and Nepalis who resided to the south called the peak Sagarmatha, 'goddess of the sky.'

The other aspect, indicated by rural-urban differentials, is the possible importance of human settlement patterns in relation to the availability of health care and related facilities such as potable water, excreta disposal systems, etc. Thus, in a special sense, it is much cheaper to make health and other basic services available to a community when it is densely settled rather than widely dispersed. It is possible to argue, however, that both these sets of factors are closely related to a third one, namely, income levels. Poorer mothers and babies have less access to health-care facilities and nourishment than those who are better off; urban communities are on an average much better off than rural communities. That economic condition plays a crucial role in determining the status of both mother and child, is beyond dispute. But the paration really is whether this is the only decisive factor or whether factors such as the availability of medical facilities, healthcare programs, and nutritional programs have an independent role. If so then the settlement patterns which affect service delivery to the mother and child target groups become a relevant consideration. These are clearly issues of some importance for policy and program planning. ",

On Friday 30th January, Hawksdrift Falconry owner Layla Bennett will be giving a seminar to students and staff on the use of falconry as a deterrent to the University’s seagull population. The talk will take place in the Aberystwyth Arts Centre Cinema at 2pm. During her talk, Layla will look at the impact that falconry has on the seagull population at the University, and aspects of the company. Layla has previously appeared on Dragon’s Den, and on Oxford Street Revealed, where she used her hawk ‘Hope’ to control the pigeon population. Along with ‘Hope’ who appeared at a similar talk on Monday 26 January, she will also be bringing ‘Monty’, her Gyrfalcon. The University has been looking for ways of controlling the seagull population on the Penglais campus, particularly in the area of the Arts Centre piazza.Herring gulls are the most common seagulls on campus. The hawks have been used to deter the seagulls from nesting on buildings on the Penglais campus.In twelve months the presence of the hawks meant that seagull numbers dropped by 50 %. Aberystwyth University’s Director of Health and Safety, Phil Maddison said; “It is within our duty of care to our staff and students at Aberystwyth to take preventative measures to reduce the risk of seagull related incidents on campus.We appreciate the protected nature of this species and therefore have opted to use this natural bird dispersal method of population control at the University.” The talk is for the University’s community of students and staff.",

This 'paper money aristocracy' of bankers and investors manipulated the banking system for their own profit, Democrats claimed, and sapped the nation's virtue by encouraging speculation and the desire for sudden, unearned wealth.

Codes of business practice may be radically different and the expatriate lifestyle can be lonely… yet many multinational companies have made little effort to prepare their employees for the shock.  The advertising giant J Walter Thompson is a case in point. ‘We call in global relocation specialists to handle the practicalities of moving home and children's education,’ says a company spokesman. ‘But most other things we leave to the individual. The people we send abroad are experienced international businessmen and women and we expect them to understand different cultural milieus. There will always be the odd problem but we would hope that these could be dealt with by our local staff.’… But even with strong and knowledgeable support in the new country Chris Crosby, managing director of TMA, a company that specialises in corporate cross- cultural changes, believes more is required. ‘Most people can identify explicit differences, such as clothing and food, which separate their culture from another and have little difficulty in adapting,’ he says. ‘More implicit differences are far harder to deal with.In the UK a business meeting is perceived as a place where a plan of action will be formulated and implemented.In other cultures, it is often just a forum for discussion.If you go abroad with the UK model as a preconception you might think that a meeting had been a disaster when it hadn't.’ Rather than getting people to adopt a different culture than their own, you have to help them adapt their own style to a new culture.Critical to this is understanding one's own culture. Without examining our own underlying perceptions it is unlikely we will get to grips with another,’ Mr. Crosby says. But people are unpredictable and not all cross - cultural situations are cut and dried; many are ambiguous, so a key element of successful working practice is to concentrate on building relationships. ‘Your job is to do the right thing for the business,’ he says firmly.You need to be clear about non - negotiables, ethically and in terms of business operations.’ ",

One example of such unexplained behavior: Honeybees communicate the sources of nectar to one another by doing a dance in a figure-eight pattern. The orientation of the dance conveys the position of the food relative to the sun's position in the sky, and the speed of the dance tells how far the food source is from the hive. Most researchers assume that the ability to perform and encode the dance is innate and shows no special intelligence. But in one study, when experimenters kept changing the site of the food source, each time moving the food 25 percent farther from the previous site, foraging honeybees began to anticipate where the food source would appear next. When the researchers arrived at the new location, they would find the bees circling the spot, waiting for their food. No one has yet explained how bees, whose brains weigh four ten-thousandths of an ounce, could have inferred the location of the new site. Other behaviors that may indicate some cognition include tool use.Many animals, like the otter who uses a stone to crack mussel shells, are capable of using objects in the natural environment as rudimentary tools.One researcher has found that mother chimpanzees occasionally show their young how to use tools to open hard nuts.In one study, chimpanzees compared two pairs of food wells containing chocolate chips.One pair might contain, say, five chips and three chips, the other our chips and three chips.Allowed to choose which pair they wanted, the chimpanzees almost always chose the one with the higher total, showing some sort of summing ability.Other chimpanzees have learned to use numerals to label quantities of items and do simple sums.",

Helium – an inert, odourless, monatomic element known to lay people as the substance that makes balloons float and voices squeak when inhaled – could be gone from this planet within a generation. Helium itself is not rare; there is actually a plentiful supply of it in the cosmos.In fact, 24 per cent of our galaxy’s elemental mass consists of helium, which makes it the second most abundant element in our universe.Because of its lightness, however, most helium vanished from our own planet many years ago.Consequently, only a miniscule proportion – 0.00052%, to be exact – remains in earth’s atmosphere.Helium is the by- product of millennia of radioactive decay from the elements thorium and uranium.The helium is mostly trapped in subterranean natural gas bunkers and commercially extracted through a method known as fractional distillation. The loss of helium on Earth would affect society greatly.Defying the perception of it as a novelty substance for parties and gimmicks, the element actually has many vital applications in society.Probably the most well known commercial usage is in airships and blimps(non - flammable helium replaced hydrogen as the lifting gas du jour after the Hindenburg catastrophe in 1932, during which an airship burst into flames and crashed to the ground killing some passengers and crew).But helium is also instrumental in deep - sea diving, where it is blended with nitrogen to mitigate the dangers of inhaling ordinary air under high pressure; as a cleaning agent for rocket engines; and, in its most prevalent use, as a coolant for superconducting magnets in hospital MRI(magnetic resonance imaging) scanners.",

While he was still a boy, his father and older brother died, and he became responsible for supporting his family . Like most of the children in his town, he attended school only two or three months a year. Later, with the help of several teachers, he was able to study law and become a member of the Massachusetts bar, but he never forgot those early struggles. While serving in the Massachusetts legislature, he signed an historic education bill that set up a state board of education. Without regret, he gave up his successful legal practice and political career to become the first secretary of the board. There he exercised an enormous influence during the critical period of reconstruction that brought into existence the American graded elementary school as a substitute for the older district school system.  Under his leadership, the curriculum was restructured, the school year was increased to a minimum of six months, and mandatory schooling was extended to age sixteen. Other important reforms that came into existence under Mann’s guidance included the establishment of state normal schools for teacher training, institutes for in service teacher education, and lyceums for adult education. He was also instrumental in improving salaries for teachers and creating school libraries. Mann’s ideas about school reform were developed and distributed in the twelve annual reports to the state of Massachusetts that he wrote during his tenure as secretary of education. Considered quite radical at the time, the Massachusetts reforms later served as a model for the nation’s educational system. Mann was formally recognized as the father of public education. During his lifetime, Horace Mann worked tirelessly to extend educational opportunities to agrarian families and the children of poor laborers.

    para: " At just 19 years old, King Tutankhamen was still a teenager when he died in 1322 B.C. He ruled over all of Egypt for ten years, the last king of a powerful family that had ruled Egypt for centuries. After his death, the body of King Tut (as Tutankhamen is usually known today) was placed in a luxurious, gold-filled tomb. There, he lay forgotten until the tomb's eventual discovery in 1922. Although we know a lot about his life, the reason for King Tut's death at such a young age has remained a mystery, with murder the most extreme possibility. Now, improved X-ray technology and DNA testing are offering new clues into the life and death of the boy-king. When British archeologist Howard Carter opened King Tut's tomb, it was still full of gold and other amazing items. Carter spent months carefully recording the treasures. When he and his team then attempted to remove King Tut's mummy, they found that it had become attached to its solid gold coffin. Unfortunately, they did a great deal of damage to the mummy while removing it.In 1968, archeologists conducted an examination of King Tut's mummy using simple X-ray technology. Three important discoveries led to various theories about his death. The X-rays showed that bones in Tut's chest were missing.Some guessed the damage was caused by a war injury or an accident.There was a small hole in the back of the skull, and pieces of bone inside it, causing many to believe that Tut was killed by a blow to the back of the head.Was he murdered by people wanting to take control of Egypt? A serious fracture was discovered on Tut's left leg. Tut was hurt a few hours before his death. This could have been the result of an accident. Could an infection from the injury have killed Tut? ",

In the twenties, jazz became the hottest new thing in dance music, much as ragtime had at the turn of the century, and as would rhythm and blues in the fifties, and disco in the seventies.But two characteristics distinguish jazz from other dance music.The first is improvisation, the changing of a musical phrase according to the player's inspiration. Like all artists, jazz musicians strive for an individual style, and the improvise or paraphrased is a jazz musician's main opportunity to display his or her individuality.In early jazz, musicians often improvised melodies collectively, thus creating a kind of polyphony.There was little soloing as such, although some New Orleans players, particularly cornet player Buddy Bolden, achieved local fame for their ability to improvise a solo.Later the idea of the chorus- long or multichorus solo took hold.Louis Armstrong's instrumental brilliance, demonstrated through extended solos, was a major influence in this development.  Even in the early twenties, however, some jazz bands had featured soloists. Similarly, show orchestras and carnival bands often included one or two such get off musicians. Later in the fifties, rock became the king of music and was so popular as its friend – rhythm and blues. ",

    para: " Educators and researchers have categorized those different processing methods into broad categories they call Learning Styles or Learning Preferences. There are three basic styles: Aural, Visual and Kinesthetic. While a handful of other categories have also been thrown into the ring from time to time, most of them fit within one of the three major styles. Understanding the way you or your child prefers to take in information can help you maximize learning opportunities inside and outside the traditional classroom. The word kinesthetic is related to a Greek word that means movement, and certainly these learners prefer to learn by doing something physical (such as a hands-on activity or a field trip). But there's more to it than that. Some researchers have defined this style as preference for learning related to experience and practice—in other words, they prefer their learning to be connected with reality. Researchers caution that these learning styles are not destiny, and they are not set in stone. They are just preferences. In fact, most people favor two or more of the styles, depending on the situation. Additionally, information presented in one style can serve to reinforce the same information presented in a different one—such as when the text and graphics in a textbook complement each other to make the same point. Understanding the ways you prefer to take in and remember information can help with learning and retaining information, particularly when you're dealing with something that is difficult for you. Alternatively, when you have the opportunity to work with something that comes easily, you might choose to practice using methods from different styles. ",

That Wednesday evening, millions of British subjects in England and the colonies went peacefully to sleep and did not wake up until twelve days later. Behind this feat of narcoleptic prowess was not same revolutionary hypnotic technique or miraculous pharmaceutical discovered in the West Indies. It was, rather, the British Calendar Act of 1751, which declared the day after Wednesday 2nd to be Thursday 14th. Prior to that cataleptic September evening, the official British calendar differed from that of continental Europe by eleven days—that is, September 2 in London was September 13 in Paris, Lisbon, and Berlin. The discrepancy had sprung from Britain's continued use of the Julian calendar, which had also been the official calendar of Europe from its invention by Julius Caesar (after wham it was named) in 45 B.C. until the decree of Pope Gregory XIII in 1582. Caesar's calendar, which consisted of eleven months of or 31 days and a 28-day February (extended to 29 days every fourth year), was actually quite accurate: it erred from the real solar calendar by only 11.5 minutes a year. After centuries, though, even a small inaccuracy like this adds up. By the sixteenth century, it had put the Julian calendar behind the solar one by 10 days. In Europe, in 1582, Pope Gregory XIII ordered the advancement of the Julian calendar by 10 days and introduced a new corrective device to curb further error century years such as 1700 or 1800 would no longer be counted as leap years, unless they were (like 1600 or 2000) divisible by 400.

Current work on these lines has already shown their potential for many medical benefits. However, stem cell research is controversial. Its advocates and opponents are stuck in an ongoing debate.The primary objection to stem cell research is that it requires the use of human embryos.Opponent of stem cell research feel that life begins at conception.Thus, they consider abortion as a means of collecting stem cells from human embryos unethical.They oppose it on moral and religious grounds.Advocates, however, argue that an embryo is not life until it develops human form or is born.They believe the potential discovery of cures to life- threating diseases outweighs any objection to the research.The sharp disagreement of cures to life - threatening diseases outweighs any objection to the research.The sharp disagreement over what constitutes life has put stem cell research on the rocks.In fact, many nations have decided to severely restrict but not halt further embryonic stem cell research.It is considered illegal in those countries to create an embryo for the purpose of experimentation.As a result, only donated embryos can be used now.As these embryos would be destroyed anyways, the ban addresses some of the concerns that critics have.Researchers, on the other hand, consider this a stopgap measure that fails to fully address the issue.",

Codes of business practice may be radically different and the expatriate lifestyle can be lonely… yet many multinational companies have made little effort to prepare their employees for the shock.The advertising giant J Walter Thompson is a case in point. ‘We call in global relocation specialists to handle the practicalities of moving home and children's education,’ says a company spokesman. ‘But most other things we leave to the individual.

There will always be the odd problem but we would hope that these could be dealt with by our local staff.’…But even with strong and knowledgeable support in the new country Chris Crosby, managing director of TMA, a company that specialises in corporate cross- cultural changes, believes more is required.‘Most people can identify explicit differences, such as clothing and food, which separate their culture from another and have little difficulty in adapting,’ he says. ‘More implicit differences are far harder to deal with.In the UK a business meeting is perceived as a place where a plan of action will be formulated and implemented.In other cultures, it is often just a forum for discussion.If you go abroad with the UK model as a preconception you might think that a meeting had been a disaster when it hadn't.’Rather than getting people to adopt a different culture than their own, you have to help them adapt their own style to a new culture.Critical to this is understanding one's own culture. Without examining our own underlying perceptions it is unlikely we will get to grips with another,’ Mr. Crosby says.But people are unpredictable and not all cross - cultural situations are cut and dried; many are ambiguous, so a key element of successful working practice is to concentrate on building relationships. ‘Your job is to do the right thing for the business,’ he says firmly.You need to be clear about non - negotiables, ethically and in terms of business operations.’ ",
