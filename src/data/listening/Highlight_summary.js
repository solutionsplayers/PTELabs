      `While the speaker previously was an opponent of nuclear power for a variety of political, social and environmental reasons, he now changed his position due to the problem of global warming and he supports the nuclear industry with efforts to re-establish itself as a leading player in the energy field.`,
      `The speaker is an opponent of nuclear power for environmental reasons, he asserts that nuclear power planters in reactors generate a high level of greenhouse gases and actually contribute to global warming rather than reduce it. His biggest concern, however, is the disposal the radioactive waste.`,

It is finding this difficult partly because the people who work in the field haven't previously indirected too much with people in the other field and because of external structures that hinder rather than support such initiatives`,
