White stripes reflect light very well, while black stripes reflect hardly any lights at all. The barcode scanners shines light ===== across the barcode, simultaneously detecting and recording a pattern of reflected and non-reflected light. The scanner then ===== this pattern into an electrical signal that the computer can understand. All scanners must include computer software to interpret the barcode once it has been entered. This simple principle has transformed the way we are able to ===== data and the way in which many businesses handled record keeping."

In other words, they found that both men and women tended to pursue mates just 25 percent more desirable than themselves.
